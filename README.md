Think of slack, MS Teams, Facebook Messenger, Discord, and more...</p>
<p>According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheme "Wikipedia on Pheme"), the goddess Pheme (aka Fama, Ossa) was described as "she who initiates and furthers communication".  Pheme was said to have pried into the affairs of mortals and gods, then repeated what she learned, starting off at first with just a dull whisper, but repeating it louder each time, until everyone knew. In art, she was usually depicted with wings and a trumpet.</p>

## Structure
The structure is a simple one. Each application has it's own needs for sending notifications (messages), so the goals is to make no assumptions on how a message should look.
